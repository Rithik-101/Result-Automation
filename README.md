# Result-Automation
It is a personal project in python using Selenium, in which I automated the task of result data collection from a website and store it in excel using pandas.

It is a personal project, which I did to learn about web automation.
I did it while constantly learning about selenium.
So, it won't be the most efficient program, but i'll try to update it as I learn more.
Hope it gives you some insight about Selenium and web automation and Encourages you to learn as well.

Some key notes about the code:
1. Whichever website you are working with, you'll need to copy the XPATH of the element from where you are reading or writing.
2. While writing data to data frame, be sure to first format the data correctly.


   
To copy XPATH of the element, follow these steps.  
1: Right click on the element, whose XPATH you want and click inspect. (You'll see the HTML code of the website).   
2: Right click on the blue highlighted area.  
3. Choose copy > copy full Xpath.  
4. Paste it in code.
