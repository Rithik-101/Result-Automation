# Result-Automation
It is a personal project in python using Selenium, in which I automated the task of result data collection from a website and store it in excel using pandas.

It is a personal project, which I did to learn about web automation.
I did it while constantly learning about selenium.
So, it won't be the most efficient program, but i'll try to update it as I learn more.
Hope it gives you some insight about Selenium and web automation and Encourages you to learn as well.
